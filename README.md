# Road-Accident-Detection-System-And-Alert-System-Using-Deep-Learning

🚗 Road Accident Detection System and Alert System using Deep Learning

This project is an AI-powered solution designed to automatically detect road accidents from video feeds/images and send real-time alerts to emergency services. Using deep learning techniques for image classification and object detection, the system can differentiate between accident and non-accident scenarios, helping reduce response time and potentially save lives.

🔑 Features

Accident detection using deep learning models.

Real-time monitoring of traffic video feeds.

Automated alert generation for quick emergency response.

Scalable for integration with CCTV, IoT devices, or dashcams.

Custom dataset prepared for training accident vs. non-accident scenarios.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (Deep Learning)

OpenCV (Image Processing)


Twilio API / Email API (for alert notifications)

📂 Dataset

Accident and Non-Accident images/videos collected and preprocessed.

Data augmentation techniques applied to improve model generalization.

🚀 How It Works

Input video/image stream is processed frame by frame.

Deep learning model classifies whether an accident occurred.

If an accident is detected, the system triggers an alert (SMS/Email).

Emergency responders receive accident location and details.
